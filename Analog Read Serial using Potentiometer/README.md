# ANALOG SERIAL READER USING POTENTIOMETER
## AIM:
**Read a potentiometer, print its state out to the Arduino Serial Monitor**
## HARDWARES REQUIRED:

**- Arduino Uno or Pro Mini**

**- 10k ohm Potentiometer**

**- Bread board**

**- Connecting wires(Jumper Wires)**

**- Arduino IDE**

### Potentiometer:

**A potentiometer is a simple mechanical device that provides a varying amount of resistance when its shaft is turned. By passing voltage through a potentiometer and into an analog input on your board, it is possible to measure the amount of resistance produced by a potentiometer (or pot for short) as an analog value. In this example you will monitor the state of your potentiometer after establishing serial communication between your Arduino and your computer running the Arduino Software (IDE).**
