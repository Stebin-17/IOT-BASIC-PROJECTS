# Arduino sequential LED Dancing Light

1. To build led chaser we need a breadboard to create a connection between a component.

2. we need 8 LEDs of the same color or a different color.

3. Attach all LEDs to the breadboard in parallel form.

4. After the led is attached, now connect the resistor to the positive pin of all LEDs.

5. Now connect the end of the resistors to pin  7, 8, 9, 10, 11,12, 13 of the Arduino using a jumper wire.

6. Connect the negative pin of all LEDs to the GND pin of Arduino using a jumper wire.

7. Now the circuit is ready to upload the code through Arduino Uno.

# Components Required:

  - 1 × Arduino board.

  - 1 × Breadboard.

  - 8 × 5mm Led.

  - 9 × Jumper wires (M).
